-- Delta

-- respect to the average expenses (total expenses divided by the number of
-- people).

-- Greedy Balancing algorithm

-- $theory
-- The high-level idea of the algorithm is as follows: given a list of
-- expenses, find the maximum and minimum expense, and transfer the expenses
-- of the maximum to the minimum, but limit the transfered amount to the
-- smallest deficiency, where deficiency is defined as the absolute value of
-- the difference between the expense and the average expense.
-- Then apply the transfer to the list of expenses, and repeat until the
-- list is @e@-balanced (see 'Types.balanced').
--
-- Note: in some cases, this algorithm will generate transfers that have
-- an amount lower than the given epsilon, for instance, when transfering from
-- many accounts with small deficiencies to a single account with a large
-- deficiency. 
--
-- Note: A related concept to @e@-balance is @d@-deficiency, which is defined
-- as follows:
-- A set of expenses @E@ is @d@-deficient (@d@ > 0) if
--
-- > forall e in |e - avg E| < d where avg E = (sum E)/|E|
--
-- We can then prove that if E is (e/2)-deficient, then it is e-balanced.
--
-- > Let 2d = e, then
-- > E is d-deficient
-- > iff forall e' in E: |e' - avg E| < d
-- > iff forall e1,e2 in E: |e1 - e2| < | avg E + d - (avgE - d) |
-- >                                  = | d + d |
-- >                                  = 2d
-- >                                  = e
-- > iff E is e-balanced (QED)
--
-- However, we can also simply look at the differences of the deficiencies,
-- and apply regular @e@-balance, that is, a list of expenses @E@ is
-- @e@-balanced iff @[e' - avg E | e' <- E]@ is @e@-balanced.


-- | Create a list of transfers to e-balance a list of deltas.
-- Given a list of deltas (where every payer must be unique), create a list
-- of transfers, such that the result of applying those transfers to the deltas
-- is e-balanced (see 'Types.balanced').
