# Expense Balancing


A code experiment to equalise the balances of a group of people.

## Compiling and running


Using the stack tool (https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/):

```
$ stack setup
$ stack build
```

## General Usage

The most likely use case for this project is a library for your own program,
or directly from GHCi (use `stack ghci`).

## Example Program

* Using the flow-network based algorithm:

  ```
  $ stack exec balancer-example --- 100
  ```

* Using the greedy algorithm (a lot faster):

  ```
  $ stack exec balancer-example --- greedy 1000
  ```

* The following version also uses the greedy algorithm, but does not print
  output (mainly for performance testing).

  ```
  $ stack exec balancer-example --- noprint 4000
  ```
